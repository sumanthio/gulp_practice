        Technically, I am a CS guy with 2 years of progressive experience in web making. Freelanced as a PHP dev for a PR agency. And then began my journey as a
        UI Engineer, with <a href="http://www.fissionlabs.com" target="_blank">Fission Labs</a>. It's been a quick year, but quite challenging though. Happened to experience the actual Bay area work flow, culture and hacks.
        On the other side of coin, I am a Keyboard artist and I freelance that too actually. About to start my Youtube career as a cover artist.

        Not exactly a blog, this is just piece of feature I had an idea to add.
        I write a lot though, it's been quiet a while actually. Used to write a lot when I was in college, which is like a while ago.
        There were a couple of blogs, <a href="https://expressmuzic.wordpress.com" target="_blank">one</a> which I used to write music reviews and stuff. And the
        <a href="http://strictlybtech.blogspot.in" target="_blank">other</a> is all about my philosophy and frustration
