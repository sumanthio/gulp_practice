        Technically, I am a CS guy with 2 years of progressive experience in web making. Freelanced for a PR agency and built an internal chat system over LAN. Then began my journey
        with <a href="http://www.fissionlabs.in" target="_blank">Fission Labs</a>. It's been a year quickly, but quite challenging though. Happened to experience the actual Bay area work culture and flow hacks.

        Not exactly a blog, this is just piece of feature I had an idea to add.
        I write a lot though, it's been quiet a while actually. Used to write a lot when I was in college, which is like a while ago.
        There were a couple of blogs, <a href="https://expressmuzic.wordpress.com" target="_blank">one</a> which I used to write music reviews and stuff. And the
        <a href="http://strictlybtech.blogspot.in" target="_blank">other</a> is all about my philosphy and frustration
